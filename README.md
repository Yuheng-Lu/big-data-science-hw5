*Yuheng Lu*

* This repo pertains to Homework 5 for CSCI-GA 3033, Big Data Science.
* The original dataset can be found in `Breast_Cancer_dataset.csv`.
* The processed dataset is available in `Preprocessed_Breast_Cancer_dataset.csv`.
* For an explanation of the preprocessing methods used, please refer to `HW5.ipynb`.
* Dimensionality reduction is achieved through Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
* Information Gain is utilized for feature selection.
* Five distinct models are developed:
  * KNN
  * Na√Øve Bayes
  * C4.5 Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * Gradient Boosting
* Hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search is applied to two of these models.
* For a comprehensive overview of model construction and performance analysis, please see `HW5.ipynb`.
